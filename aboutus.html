					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The Pleasure Island Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1937 with Robert Cronly Plummer serving as the first President. Robert was the son of Carolina Beach's very first Mayor, John W. Plummer. The Chamber, then called the Carolina Beach Chamber of Commerce, was formed as a non-profit, membership-based organization with a focus on the business community of the island.</p>
